## Branch naming scheme
- All branches must start with a lowercase 'v'
- All branches must have a decimal point between the name of the parent branch and the proposed branch
- A branch may never have a '.1' at the end of it. Instead, it must be '.2'
- There may never be more than 1 digit next to another digit. They must always be seperated by a decimal point
